# Video Streaming App - README

Welcome to the Video Streaming App project! This application is a full-stack video streaming platform built using Node.js, Mongoose, and React. It allows users to upload, view, edit, and delete videos, as well as subscribe to other users and receive video recommendations based on their viewing history. Below, you'll find information on how to set up and use the application.

## Getting Started

To run the Video Streaming App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the server (Node.js) and the client (React):
   ```
   cd video-streaming-app
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection in the `server/config/db.js` file.

4. Start the server:
   ```
   cd ..
   npm start
   ```

5. Start the React client:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

Your Video Streaming App should now be running locally. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technical Stack

The Video Streaming App is built using the following technologies and tools:

- Node.js: Used for server-side scripting and handling backend logic.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, used for database management.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture: Organizes the codebase into separate modules for easy development and maintenance.

## Features

The Video Streaming App offers the following features:

1. **Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access certain features.

2. **MVC Architecture**: The application follows the MVC architecture, separating code into models, views, and controllers to enhance code organization and maintainability.

3. **Video Upload and Conversion**: Users can upload videos along with thumbnails. The application automatically converts videos to different resolutions, which users can customize.

4. **Video Management**: Users can delete and edit their uploaded videos.

5. **User Subscriptions**: Users can subscribe to other users and watch their videos.

6. **Recommendation System**: The application recommends videos to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

7. **Video Search**: Users can search for videos based on their titles.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

```
video-streaming-app/
|-- client/          # React frontend
|-- server/          # Node.js backend
|-- public/          # Public assets
|-- README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Authentication

User authentication is implemented to ensure that only registered and logged-in users can access certain parts of the application. Passport.js or a similar authentication middleware is typically used for this purpose.

## MVC Architecture

The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Here's a breakdown of the components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It includes database models for videos, users, and subscriptions.

- **View**: Handles the presentation and user interface. React components are responsible for rendering the user interface.

- **Controller**: Manages the flow of data between the Model and the View. It handles user requests, routes them to the appropriate functions, and updates the Model and View accordingly.

## Video Upload and Conversion

Users can upload videos and thumbnails to the platform. The application automatically converts these videos into different resolutions, allowing users to customize their viewing experience.

## User Subscriptions

Users can subscribe to other users on the platform. Subscribed users will see the uploaded videos from the users they follow in their feed.

## Recommendation System

The platform recommends videos to users based on their viewing history and preferences. This enhances user engagement and provides personalized content.

## Searching for Videos

Users can search for videos based on their titles. The search functionality makes it easy for users to discover content that interests them.
